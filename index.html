  Background Information
</h2>
</div>

<div class="divBackground">
  <p1>
    As you can obviously tell, my name is Chris, I'm 21 years old and studying the Bachelor of Information Technology. <br>
    I was born and raised here in Australia with a dad who came here from the UK, making me half English. <br> <br>
    Prior to being at RMIT, I went back to school to do both years of my VCE at TAFE in order to get into university (as I did half of my first semester of high school and dropped out). Although life got in the way near exam time meaning I absolutely
    flunked them. <br>
    This led me to doing a Certificate IV in IT and a Diploma of Software Development at TAFE, and now I'm here. Going on to do computer science would be great. <br><br>
    I was going to put down me being half English as my 'interesting fact' but I had to use that for my nationality/culture which makes my interesting fact is the fact that I was born, which either says a lot or nothing about me depending on how you
    look at it. <br>
    Although my hobbies would be the standard video games & anime type stuff, and that I enjoy doing 3D modelling.

  <h2>
    Interest in IT
  </h2>
  <p>
    My interest in IT started when I was about 13 or 14 years old. I always enjoyed learning about the insides of a standard computer, what all the parts do, how to take things apart, etc.<br>
    There wasn't really something that sparked my interest, but that its always been there as I have always been around and used technology. The most IT experience I have, aside from studies at TAFE, is stuff done in my spare time. Fixing and messing
    around with computers, and learning software development/computer science topics in my spare time.<br>
    It's hard to say if I have a super specific area of IT that I am interested in the most (at the moment), but it would most likely be software development (Windows and Linux environments, game dev or reverse engineering using hex editors and IDA
    for example), and that I would like learn a lot more about cyber security (network
    security and critical infrastructure, as they say)<br><br>
    The main reason for coming to RMIT is pretty much only because I couldn't get into Monash. While I'm here I hope to learn not only about software development and cyber security, but many areas that that fall under IT as I wish to expand my
    knowledge as much as possible.

    The position described is regarded as a "penetration tester", meaning it will be this roles responsibility to discover security flaws. In other words, ethical hacking. With permission, you will "hack" the software or network and report back how
    you did it so they can be patched. This also includes analysing source code for any security flaws. <br>
    Penetration testing/ethical hacking is the main area of cyber security that interests me the most, as this sort of thing can require a low level understanding of the software or hardware being used, which I've always found interesting (the low
    level aspect). <br>
    The main skills required for this position and most likely many others like it are: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Great communcation skills, meaning you can work together as a team, clearly discuss plans and relay vital information to your team or the client</li>
    <li>"Practical skills" in regards to penetration testing. This means being familiar with the most common cyber security faults found and having a solid understanding of them (how they're performed and why). </li>
    <li>Knowledge and experience with many pieces of software designed to help people find security faults (SQLmap, Burpsuite, etc)</li>
    <li>Knowledge/understanding of cyber security open standards and methodologies (OWASP, PTES, OSSTM)</li>
    <li>Plenty of real world experience in penetration testing</li>
  </ul> <br>

  At the moment, I have practically none of the skills required for this sort of thing, aside from knowing what an SQL injection is, how it's performed and why it happens. <br>
  The main ways to actually obtaining the skills and knowledge is to, continue my studies picking relevant courses when possibles, gain real world experience most likely through an internship and of course, self study in my spare time.

    <!--Looking at these results, I believe that they are partially accurate of my actual personality. These mean quite a bit to me in regards to how this will impact me working in a team. Although the "learning style" is completely wrong, as I don't believe that I have any particular preferred style, but a bit of them all.
    I think it will be important to take certain aspects of these results into consideration heading into the future and working with groups (including the one for this course). Specifically, the major personality traits to consider would be being introverted, unofocused and constant improvement/self critical.
    As we will be working in a group, being introverted is a no go. Working in a group means reguarly communicating/talking to your team members to coordinate your responsibilities, working together to find solutions to the task and personal disputes. None of this is possible with introverted actions.
    It will be important to be focused to get anything done especially when other team members are relying on you. Being unfocused will mean that I won't be able to "buckle down" to get the main task at hand done, getting too caught up or overthinking the problems at hand or with totally unrelated things.
    Being overly self critical/constantly trying to improve is both a good thing and a bad thing. It is good since it means the end result of my work/contribution to the team means it will (hopefully) be of high effort and quality. Although this can also be bad as it may mean some things could take far too long to get completed. This means that I may be restarting things over or focusing too much time on one thing to get it perfect. Of course as there are deadlines with this and many things in life, this won't be very sustainable so I'll need to drop my standards, so to say.
    One of the results also lists "agreeableness", which again is good and bad. Good as it means less chance for conflict to arise from my decisions/actions, but may hinder critical discussion of ideas and contributions to the team. -->
    Looking at these results, they are partically accurate and describe some important details/traits to consider when working in a group. These specific traits are more introverted and perfectionist ones. Working in a team is the opposite of being
    introverted as it is vital that you clearly and reguarly communicate with others about the task/project (which may not happen if I happen to be introverted). Being overly critical and having a constant desire to improve means that while the work
    should be of high quality, also means I may spend far too long on small details, leading more important tasks to suffer and really stretching that deadline (which would severly dissapoint the team.) Having high agreeableness is good as it means
    the chance of conflict is reduced, but it's important to have critical discussion of your ideas and contributions to get not only consistent effort/quality, but also the best ideas. The learning style test was completely wrong, as I'm more a mix
    of all the styles, so I do not have much to say about that part.

  <h2>
    IT Project Idea
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Video Game via Unity / C#
  </h3>

  <h3>
    Project Overview
  </h3>
  <p>
    WMy project idea for the semester is video game built via Unity 5 with C# (3D).</br>
    Specifically:
  <ul>
    <li>It will be a more linear survival horror orientated game, with focus on resource management and hints of stealth mechanics.<br>
    <li>Able to progress with out without engaging in combat (allowing for more player choice), with combat focusing more on a ranged perspective
    <li>The AI of the game will be more attentive to details for the stealth aspects (reacting to player bumping into objects, things falling over and your shadow for example).
    <li>The game will target Windows platforms for now and be runnable on low end machines, or in other words a low fidelity style that of early 6th generation (roughly 10k polys in any given scene).
  </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>
    Motivation
  </h3>
  <p>
    A project like this has the potential to be successful as interest in both big budget, high fidelity and indie low poly survival horror games have seen a sudden rise in interest the last couple of years from a dedicated community. For example,
    the following are the predicted sales for both a long running big budget franchise and an entirely new IP from a lower budget indie studio.

    <br>
    Resident Evil 8:

    (Numbers provided by the third party service SteamSpy). <br> <br>
    The features also hav e the potential to attract people as they are fairly original for this style of game (advanced stealth mechanics, no need for combat etc), meaning it may serve as a breath of fresh air. It is using elements not normally seen in such a combination.
